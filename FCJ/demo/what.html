<!--     Algorithmic trading <i>(automated trading, black-box trading or algo-trading) </i> 
    is the process of using computers programs to follow a defined set of instructions (an algorithm) 
    for placing a trade in order in the market. 
 -->
 <p2>
    <h4> The what? </h4> <!-- Nearly 80% of U.S. equities are traded using algorithms today.  -->
    The hustle and bustle of a trading floor where all the activity was witnessed for decades is now mostly replaced by chunks of code. 
    Algorithmic trading code is able of executing orders within micro-seconds, something that a regular trader could have only dreamed of. 
    <!-- Algorithms which have slowly, but steadily replaced traders on the floor of stock exchanges are capable of executing orders a matter of microseconds and are used by nearly every big bank, investment firm and player in the market.  -->
    These algorithms are adopted and used by nearly every big bank, investment firm and player in the market. The majority of these algorithms are curated in-house at the firms and occasionally outsources from third-party algo-trading companies who supply the technology to execute trading strategies. 

    <br> <h4> The how? </h4> 
    These algorithms work very well in liquid markets - where there is more opportunity for trading, rather than relatively stable markets. So equities are a big hit for code, whereas bond markets are slower. 
    Apart from profit opportunities for the trader, algorithms make markets more liquid and makes trading more systematic by ruling out the impact of human emotions on trading activities.
