High frequency trading causes stock market crashes due to how the high frequency algorithms are set up.  <br>
If the algorithms detect something that they deem of interest they will certainly act upon it.  

A prime example is that of the infamous <h2> Flash Crash of May 2010 </h2>

In May 2010, the trading algorithms picked up some signal negative news that was tweeted, and quickly started selling stock. The  market dropped 10 percent in the matter of minutes. The algorithms did not bother to figure out that the news was fake, and that people on twitter can say anything.  
This crash was unnecessary, and completely the fault of high frequency trading.
