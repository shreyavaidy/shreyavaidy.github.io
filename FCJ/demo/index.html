    Algorithmic trading <i>(automated trading, black-box trading or algo-trading) </i> 
    is the process of using computers programs to follow a defined set of instructions (an algorithm) 
    for placing a trade in order in the market. 

    <h4> Who uses it? </h4> Nearly 70% of U.S. equities are traded using algoritms today. <br>

    <h4> Why is it used? </h4> Like most things, these algorithms have pros and cons to them. 
         Simple put, these algorithms can generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader.

         The defined sets of rules are based on timing, price, quantity or any mathematical model. Apart from profit opportunities for the trader, algo-trading makes markets more liquid and makes trading more systematic by ruling out the impact of human emotions on trading activities. 
         The greatest portion of today\â€™s algo-trading is high frequency trading (HFT), which attempts to capitalize on placing a large number of orders at very fast speeds across multiple markets and multiple decision parameters, based on pre-programmed instructions.
