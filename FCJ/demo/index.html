    With the advent of technology in the last two decades, algorithmic trading has overtaken the way financial markets work. 
    The code that controls the movement of the trades makes up more than 80% of the trades today. <br> <br>
    
    These algorithms which have slowly, but steadily replaced traders on the floor of stock exchanges are capable of executing orders a matter of microseconds and are used by nearly every big bank, investment firm and player in the market. 
    The hustle and bustle of a trading floor where the activity of the markets were witnessed for decades have now been replaced by chunks of codes that operate over speeds much much higher than any trader would execute in their day-to-day. These algorithms having been adopted far and wide after the advent of technology in financial sectors in the late 90s. Today, they are said to control more than 80% of the trades in the U.S. equities market.

    These algorithms control trades that might operate over your 401K plan or retirement savings.
    <br>
    They come at a cheap cost and high efficiency gain. The transparency around their operation is important and that is what I am trying to showcase in this explainer.
