I use data to figure out what needs to be built ? why it needs to built ? and most importantly how do we measure the success of what we built.

I have developed a strong business & technical acumen in implementing effective solutions for complex business problems over the past 5 + years in various product and data roles combined with a Master's from Carnegie Mellon University.
