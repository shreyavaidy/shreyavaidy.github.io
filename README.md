* Here you'll find information about me, my life (which is presumably cool if you bothered to come this far and read this README in the github repo) and the various things I tried coding or making.
* I'll update my projects from classes I take @columbia and the work I do for my side-hustle and other random stuff from my spare-time.
* I will also try to include some stuff that I am fond of here if I find time. 

Enjoy!
