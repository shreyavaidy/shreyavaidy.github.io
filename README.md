* Here you'll find information about me, my life (which is presumably cool if you bothered to come this far and read my repo) and the various things I tried coding or making.
* I'll update my projects from classes I take @columbia and the work I do for my side-hustle and other random stuff from my spare-time
* I will also try to push some cool stuff that I am fond of here to spark curiosity and make me look pretty damn awesome.

Have fun reading it all!
