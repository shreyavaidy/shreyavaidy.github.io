        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Shreya!</h1>
				<p> I am a Dual Masters student at Columbia University studying Computer Science Engineering and Journalism.
					
					I want to believe in it all...music and art, faith and love.	
					Growing up as a single child with a relentless imagination and virtually no curtailment, I pushed myself to pursue all what I saw and liked. In this pursuit I think I've now picked up an eclectic set of skills.	I am currently pursuing a dual masters in Computer Science and Journalism at Columbia University and exploring the intersection of all things data, UI/UX, culture, sustainability and more.

					I am currently pursuing a dual masters in Computer Science and Journalism at Columbia University and exploring the intersection of all things data, UI/UX, culture, sustainability and more.

					I love music and singing. Enjoying a soulful sad song, I croon an eclectic mix of Carnatic music, Adele, Beyonce and would wish to be laid to rest with the same. I am also extremely good at making TV references that no one understands. I love to travel and write a blog where you can read about this in detail. Go check it out if you have the time!
